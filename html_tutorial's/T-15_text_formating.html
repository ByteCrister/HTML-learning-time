	<h2 style="text-align:left; color:blue"><u>1993 - Present</u></h2>
	<p><sup>The</sup> first version of <b>HTML</b> was written by Tim Berners-Lee in <del>1993</del>. Since then, there have been many different versions of <strong>HTML</strong>. <i><u>The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01</u></i>, which became an official standard in <i>December</i> <sub>1999</sub>.</p>
	
	<p style="text-align:justify"><small>Another</small> version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. XML is a standard markup language that is used to create other markup languages. Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML (Geography Markup Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication). Since each of these languages was written in a common language (XML), their content can easily be shared across applications. This makes XML potentially very powerful, and it's no surprise that the W3C would create an XML version of HTML (again, called XHTML).</p>
	
	<p style="color:red"><strong>XHTML became an official standard in 2000, and was updated in <u>2002</u>. XHTML is very similar to HTML, but has stricter rules.</strong></p>
